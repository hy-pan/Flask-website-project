This is a small web service including frontend and backend using the flask framwork. 

I'd like to say that the flask is a very convenient tool for developing samll web service but not suitable for large project.

Front end
-----
HTML, css and js.

Back end
-----
python3.

What is the service about
-----
User can upload a picture onto the server, the server will call deep learning model in the back end for image recognition and then return the processed image to the user.

How to run
-----
1. Install Flask framwork

2. Replace with your own inference model in the server.py file and images

3. Run the python3 server.py command in the terminal

PS: Unix is required.
